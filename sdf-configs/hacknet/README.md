This directory contains SDF templates used for developing Hacknet Extensions.

In order to actually use these in the development process, you will need to download (and potentially build) [SDF2XML](https://github.com/Maowcraft/SDF2XML).

**SDF2XML Syntax:** `program.jar "<input>.sdf" "<output>.xml"`
