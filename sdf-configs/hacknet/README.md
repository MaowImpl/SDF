This directory contains SDF templates used for developing Hacknet Extensions.

In order to actually use these in the development process, you will need to download [SDF2XML](https://github.com/Maowcraft/SDF2XML).

**SDF2XML Syntax:** `sdf2xml.bat "<input>.sdf" "<output>.xml"`<br>
**Alternatively:** Run the batch file with no arguments to use the GUI.
